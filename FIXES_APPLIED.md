# 🔧 Issue Fixes Applied - Multimodal Content Generator

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### Issue 1: Images Not Matching Concept
**Problem**: Images were random Unsplash photos that didn't relate to the user's prompt.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ **Contextual Image Mapping**: Created intelligent keyword detection system
- ✅ **Concept-Based Categories**: Added specific image sets for:
  - ☕ Coffee/Cafe content
  - 💻 Tech/Software/Digital content  
  - 🍕 Food/Restaurant/Recipe content
  - 💪 Fitness/Health/Workout content
  - ✈️ Travel/Adventure/Vacation content
  - 👔 Fashion/Style/Clothing content
  - 💼 Business/Professional/Corporate content
- ✅ **Tone-Specific Variations**: Each concept has playful/serious/bold image variants
- ✅ **Smart Fallbacks**: Default to tone-appropriate images when no concept match

**Result**: Images now contextually match the user's prompt and selected tone.

### Issue 2: Audio Loading Indefinitely  
**Problem**: Audio was trying to load `/mock-generated-audio.mp3` which didn't exist.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ **Working Audio Data**: Created actual audio data URLs with different tones
- ✅ **Tone-Specific Audio**: Different frequency beeps for different moods:
  - 🎵 Playful: 440Hz (A4 - bright and happy)
  - 🎙️ Serious: 220Hz (A3 - deeper, professional)  
  - ⚡ Bold: 330Hz (E4 - strong and confident)
- ✅ **Audio Descriptions**: Added meaningful descriptions of what the audio represents
- ✅ **Proper Loading States**: Fixed infinite loading issues

**Result**: Audio now loads successfully and provides a demo experience of TTS capability.
