## 🚀 Why Groq?

### **Lightning Fast Performance:**
- **Sub-second response times** for most requests
- **100x faster** than traditional cloud LLM services
- **Optimized hardware** specifically designed for LLM inference
- **Consistent low latency** regardless of model size

### **Enterprise-Grade Reliability:**
- **99.9% uptime** SLA
- **Scalable infrastructure** that handles traffic spikes
- **OpenAI-compatible API** for easy integration
- **Transparent pricing** with no hidden costs

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Groq API Key
1. Go to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to "API Keys" section
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Name it something like "Content Generator API"
6. Copy the generated API key (starts with `gsk_`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` file and add your Groq API key:
   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Application
Run both the API server and frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev:api
```

This will start:
- Express API server on `http://localhost:3001`
- Vite development server on `http://localhost:8080`

## 🎯 Testing the Integration

### 1. Health Check
First, verify the API server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-XX...",
  "env": {
    "hasGroqToken": true,
    "nodeEnv": "development"
  }
}
```

### 2. Test Text Generation API
Test the text generation endpoint directly:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/generate-text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Eco-friendly water bottle for athletes",
    "tone": "playful",
    "temperature": 0.7
  }'
```

Expected response (in under 2 seconds!):
```json
{
  "headline": "🌱 Game-Changing Eco Water Bottle for Champions!",
  "caption": "Stay hydrated while saving the planet! Our sustainable bottle keeps you performing at your peak. 🏃‍♂️💚"
}
```

### 3. Test Different Tones
Try all three tones to see the different responses:

**Playful tone:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/generate-text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Smart fitness tracker", "tone": "playful"}'
```

**Serious tone:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/generate-text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Smart fitness tracker", "tone": "serious"}'
```

**Bold tone:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/generate-text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Smart fitness tracker", "tone": "bold"}'
```

## 🔍 Frontend Testing

### 1. Open the Application
Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### 2. Test Form Submission
1. Enter a product idea (e.g., "Smart home security camera")
2. Select a tone (Playful, Serious, or Bold)
3. Click "Generate Content"
4. Watch for near-instant responses! ⚡

### 3. Verify Tone Differences
Try the same product with different tones and observe how the generated content changes:
- **Playful**: Should include emojis, casual language, exciting energy
- **Serious**: Should be professional, authoritative, trustworthy
- **Bold**: Should be powerful, confident, action-oriented

## 🔧 Key Implementation Features

### Groq API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
- **Model**: `llama3-8b-8192` (Llama 3 8B with 8K context)
- **OpenAI-compatible**: Uses familiar chat completion format
- **JSON mode**: Structured output for consistent parsing
- **Ultra-fast responses**: Typically 0.5-2 seconds

### Tone-Aware Prompting
The system uses sophisticated prompts that include:
- **System prompts** that define the AI's personality for each tone
- **Style instructions** that guide the response format
- **JSON structured output** for reliable parsing

### Error Handling
- **API timeouts** (15 seconds - though Groq rarely needs it)
- **Fallback content** with tone-specific messaging
- **Graceful degradation** when the API is unavailable

### Response Parsing
- **Direct JSON parsing** of structured responses
- **Pattern-based extraction** as fallback
- **Validation** of headline and caption fields

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is required" error**
   - Make sure you've created the `.env` file
   - Verify your GROQ_API_KEY is correct and starts with `gsk_`
   - Check that the API key is not expired

2. **CORS errors**
   - Ensure both servers are running
   - Check that Vite proxy is configured correctly

3. **API authentication errors**
   - Verify your API key is valid at console.groq.com
   - Make sure you have sufficient credits/quota
   - Check for any billing issues

4. **Rate limiting errors**
   - Groq has generous rate limits
   - Free tier: 30 requests/minute
   - Paid tiers: Much higher limits

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Response time**: 0.5-2 seconds (exceptionally fast!)
- **Success rate**: >99% when properly configured
- **Token usage**: ~100-300 tokens per request
- **Rate limits**: 30/min free tier, higher for paid plans

## 💰 Pricing Information

Groq API pricing (as of 2025):
- **Llama 3 8B**: $0.05 per 1M input tokens, $0.08 per 1M output tokens
