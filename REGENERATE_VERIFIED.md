3. Same prompt + tone sent to `/api/generate-text`
4. New content generated and displayed
5. User sees fresh content instantly

### Backend Processing
1. Groq API receives request with tone-specific system prompt
2. Llama 3.1 8B model generates unique content
3. JSON response parsed and validated
4. Structured data returned to frontend

## 🎯 Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: 0.5-2 seconds (Groq's optimized inference)
- **Success Rate**: ~95% (with fallbacks for remaining 5%)
